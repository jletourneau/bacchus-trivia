      Bacchus holds trivia <strong>every Tuesday night at 7 PM at 33 Second
      Street in downtown Troy</strong>.
    %p
      It’s always free to play, and there is no hard cap on team size (though
      keeping it under eight or so people is appreciated). The team leading at
      halftime receives a free round of up to four drinks, and the winning team
      at the end of the night receives a $25 gift card to Bacchus, redeemable
      on non-trivia nights.
    %p
      Use the stairs leading down to the bar area to the left of the main
      building entrance at 33 Second Street. Free off-street evening parking is
      available two blocks west in the garage at the corner of River and State
      Street.
